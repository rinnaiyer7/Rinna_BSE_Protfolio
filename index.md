# Third Eye For The Blind
In this project i used ultrasonic sensors and waves to help the blind detect the objects in their surroundings. It warns the user with buzzers and a vibration.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone I am starting to make a talking smart glass for the blind. This project contains more than one ultrasonic sensor, vibration motor, MP# player module and more. The circuit booard which is used in the project can be designed into a spectacle shape for easy use for the blind. The audrino will be on the spectacle and this is what will detect the objects. It sill warn the person either through vibrations or beeping.
The main challenge for me was actually getting all the parts in time and actually understanding the function of each of them. Because i want able to get my vibration motors on time i decided to use a sevo motor which rotates.
In my previous milestone I only used a buzzer to warn the user. But for this one i decided to add a new second way to warn the user. This may be more efficient and a louder more effectuve way to warn the user.

# First Milestone

For first milestone I built the Third Eye or the Blind. It contains a ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, ardiuno uno board and a breadboard. THe ultrasonice sensor detects objects in its surrounding and uses the buzzer to warn the user. The buzzer vibrates and that tells the user there is a a object near by. My challenge was to get the wires connected on the correct parts of the adruino board. Even if the slightest wire was off then the whole thing wouldn't work. Once I solved that problem it was easier to finish the project. For my next mileston i will see it the sensor can detect more than just objects maybe even color or text.
